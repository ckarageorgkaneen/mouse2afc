- Find and fix bugs (by repeatedly running the protocol with different parameters)
- Decide on snake_case vs CamelCase vs camelCase (right now there is no convention)
- Add support for multiple config files (e.g. Import, Export buttons)
- Make the OmegaTable reactive/interactive
- Add support for real-time updates in "Current trial" tab fields
- Add general reflection support (task parameter GUI reflects running protocol)
- Take a long, hard, objective look at the code: simplify it
